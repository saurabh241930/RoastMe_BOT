# RoastMe_BOT


In this project I have created the Reddit Roastme data based model that generate roasts given the input image using Deep Learning

I've also written a whole [medium post](https://medium.com/@sp241930/creating-reddits-roast-me-ai-roaster-bot-13eabeb93e2f) of making this project

Library used here:

* Keras Deep learning Framework
* Reddit Api
* Python

Here are some of the results
